# Traffic

In this project I wanted to create an simulation of traffic that interacts with traffic lights and also the traffic lights interact with each other via the traffic controller. 

There are still ideas to put into, but at the moment one "car" will drive from left to right and interacts with the first traffic light (index 0). That traffic light has to interact with the other two traffic lights shown on the screen. 

## Example
![alt text](./resources/example1.png)

## Run
 - clone project
 - open the index.html file in the browser
 
 on mouse click, the two traffic lights on the most right will get random numbers of 'traffic' in their corresponding queue.
